# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I think it would be cool to add a coffee pot pouring down the right or left side of the page in a smooth animated motion or maybe a cup with animated smoke and bears or kittys etc add some aesthetics or auto music when on the page is opened or maybe a extra page new window or on just main page and or section to buy the coffee grinds and coffee cups or maybe a giftshop or maybe even a giveaway at certain ammount of coffee sold or maybe stickers bracelet etc?
